# Features Folder Convention

Every improvement in Bluemine should be isolated in its own folder:

- `features/<feature-slug>/`

Recommended contents per feature folder:

- `README.md` for what the feature does and how it works
- Optional JS/CSS assets tied to that feature
- Notes about required settings/permissions

This keeps features modular, opt-in, and easier to maintain.
